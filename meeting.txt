0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:18.410
Shilpa Joshi
Idx had a relatively shorter Sprint this week because our hack days kind of moved to this week from the beginning of the March. So we still, you know, continued working on OPT ID, but just not as much to report. And I'm sorry I missed the Tuesday meeting, so maybe this was communicated, but.
0:0:18.470 --> 0:0:45.150
Shilpa Joshi
Ohh be picked up. So we continued on some work for MFA for local users. We were able to iron out with the help of Octa tickets and a feature flag that they enabled for us. Verify that OIDC IDP is with or without fixing. Both are working as expected. We finish some investigation around routing rules which may affect how we.
0:0:45.230 --> 0:0:54.300
Shilpa Joshi
Yeah, improve improve the login flow. I've added some tickets to the backlog, you know, started grooming them with the team. So we are hoping to.
0:0:54.990 --> 0:1:13.340
Shilpa Joshi
Improved the login flow. Uh for for you know before GA so that work has kicked off. We have been working with the experimentation team to see how the OIE migration went and flags was addressed. The flag service problems were addressed by APEX.
0:1:14.110 --> 0:1:20.700
Shilpa Joshi
The thing is Sprint before last, so that's looking good. Oscar, I don't know if he's on the call, met with Oscar a couple of times.
0:1:22.280 --> 0:1:50.930
Shilpa Joshi
We did find that they need to send the instance ID that the global NAV is offering as a prop. So I think Oscar is working on that and also Oscar is there was a discussion that started for the product switching and experimentation. Do we want to leave it there? Do we wanna hide it? But I think Oscar is first trying to assert in that organization switching from the global NAV is working as expected and then we come to a decision as to what do we want to do with the product switching in the app itself right now for beta.
0:1:51.800 --> 0:1:57.450
Shilpa Joshi
I that is all for me as an IDX update. Hi Ben. Good morning.
0:1:59.740 --> 0:2:1.450
Benjamin Schaefer
Good morning, good afternoon.
0:2:3.160 --> 0:2:4.650
Daniel Lopes
Good evening and goodnight.
0:2:5.910 --> 0:2:7.100
Benjamin Schaefer
Thanks so much.
0:2:5.850 --> 0:2:7.430
Shilpa Joshi
Don't say goodnight and Daniel.
0:2:8.720 --> 0:2:11.490
Benjamin Schaefer
They thanks so much shopper for that update there.
0:2:14.910 --> 0:2:28.380
Benjamin Schaefer
I would. I don't know if we have anything super pressing for this team outside of information just around the direction that we're going to go in from the.
0:2:29.540 --> 0:2:30.50
Benjamin Schaefer
Chat.
0:2:30.700 --> 0:2:37.530
Benjamin Schaefer
Perspective Daniel, was that not by design? Ohh, come on. Ohh, that's wicked funny. I I totally thought that that was the.
0:2:38.320 --> 0:2:40.350
Daniel Lopes
No, Ben, sorry about that.
0:2:40.850 --> 0:2:43.960
Benjamin Schaefer
Oh, come on. A little Truman Show reference to kick us off.
0:2:46.290 --> 0:2:46.800
Benjamin Schaefer
Love it.
0:2:44.340 --> 0:2:46.810
Daniel Lopes
Yeah. Yeah, kind of a good movie, right?
0:2:47.670 --> 0:2:54.90
Benjamin Schaefer
It's it's. It's awesome. I mean, talk about giving somebody existential angst, gotta love movies like that.
0:2:54.740 --> 0:2:55.320
Daniel Lopes
Yes.
0:2:56.280 --> 0:3:22.860
Benjamin Schaefer
So just just to say, right, a major component of the work that we're doing right now is extending the rydc connections so that we can support more of the attributes. This will be useful for the welcome and more of the customized work within experimentation and Azure book kind of called out. But outside of that, the invitation flow is one of the most urgent features sets that we're going to be iterating on over the next two sprints.
0:3:24.230 --> 0:3:32.50
Benjamin Schaefer
We really wanna make sure that we get that feature parity with what exists in some of the other product lines and that flow is sort of ubiquitous for all of our customers.
0:3:33.220 --> 0:3:34.0
Benjamin Schaefer
In addition to that.
0:3:34.920 --> 0:3:45.110
Benjamin Schaefer
Magash isn't on this call quite yet, but we will be central. I think people are familiar with the idea of centralizing usage as a as a construct.
0:3:47.20 --> 0:4:0.690
Benjamin Schaefer
Today we have a reporting portal that lives kind of like to the left of the Paas portal. Instead of experimentation, we have a view of impressions and experiments.
0:4:2.50 --> 0:4:22.420
Benjamin Schaefer
I'm pretty sure that B2B commerce team is looking at things by way of looker dashboards that aren't exposed directly to the customers, but but all of this is about to be unified. The experimentation metrics first quickly followed by the DXP metrics we're just about to be able to get transactions.
0:4:22.830 --> 0:4:34.200
Benjamin Schaefer
A properly calculated, so that's forthcoming. We'll roll that then to be to be an ODP shortly thereafter. So just to say that that's a another feature set that we'll be expanding.
0:4:35.320 --> 0:4:38.690
Benjamin Schaefer
Lastly, you may have noticed inside of the.
0:4:39.810 --> 0:5:0.970
Benjamin Schaefer
Admin center. The first of you around entitlement management and this is a major, major component of why it is that we wanna make sure that we can show customers what actually we they have purchased and and what is available to them moving forward. The first Rep of that is in Prep right now. So you can kind of see that.
0:5:4.280 --> 0:5:5.560
Benjamin Schaefer
Outside of status though.
0:5:6.250 --> 0:5:18.580
Benjamin Schaefer
I wanted to make sure because I feel like the people that are diehards and showing up to this call are pretty aware. But given the fact that I've had two different conversations with with other folks this week that were unaware of this RGA.
0:5:19.470 --> 0:5:21.340
Benjamin Schaefer
Is the end of Q2.
0:5:23.460 --> 0:5:27.430
Benjamin Schaefer
Just three months from today, we hope to go live.
0:5:31.40 --> 0:5:37.380
Oksana Kaliniouk
When you say go live, do you mean people who want to? Or do you mean everyone?
0:5:37.940 --> 0:5:41.710
Chris Messina
People who want to, but most specifically the beta customers.
0:5:42.540 --> 0:5:44.160
Chris Messina
And their whole organization.
0:5:45.650 --> 0:5:46.920
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah, so basically we're.
0:5:45.340 --> 0:5:52.10
Oksana Kaliniouk
So what I'm hearing beta customers that go on fully on and then it's available for everyone else.
0:5:59.550 --> 0:6:0.780
Chris Messina
All the bugs, yeah.
0:5:53.70 --> 0:6:0.870
Benjamin Schaefer
I don't what it feels like right now. We're still trying to solidify the sentiment across the heads of State.
0:6:1.970 --> 0:6:3.700
Benjamin Schaefer
But the reality is.
0:6:4.860 --> 0:6:7.770
Benjamin Schaefer
For Paz products, this is an impossible.
0:6:8.180 --> 0:6:9.870
Benjamin Schaefer
Uh requirement?
0:6:10.540 --> 0:6:41.770
Benjamin Schaefer
Right. Like I'm not going to say to all of Johan's see MSNBC customers like you have to help on to opti ID, right. We may be able to push that for net new customers as a dependency in queue 3. The people that we on board, but I can't force them because there are effectively code changes that they need to be able to roll for SAS products though this is where we need to be able to get solidified points of view is Q3 will result in migrations. And I think that we should be.
0:6:41.860 --> 0:6:48.430
Benjamin Schaefer
Uh, anticipating that need for migrations because the lowest hanging fruit is all.
0:6:48.510 --> 0:7:4.310
Benjamin Schaefer
The North American customers on SAS products. This should theoretically be an easy lift and switch for them just in terms of compliance and in terms of value.
0:7:5.50 --> 0:7:15.360
Benjamin Schaefer
Especially in line with a lot of the experimenting that we want to be able to do, whether or not we will get full partnership across the board across all products remains to be seen.
0:7:31.560 --> 0:7:31.870
Benjamin Schaefer
Yep.
0:7:17.670 --> 0:7:36.600
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK. The summary of that is beta customers by the end of Q2 are fully on new customers in Q3 and on a fully on and we would like to transfer for ODP which is a SAS product, right? And we would like to transfer everyone, but we can't exactly force them too much.
0:7:37.160 --> 0:7:39.390
Benjamin Schaefer
Well, the question is truly like.
0:7:41.960 --> 0:8:12.440
Benjamin Schaefer
The what? What leverage do we have both from an internal politicking standpoint to talk about this as the course of the future? So obviously we wanna be able to push this from a customer success initiative and expert services initiative from even a product road map initiative, right? What what type of internal capital do we have relative to what kind of value prop can we provide for our customers? And my hope is that this is very high.
0:8:13.680 --> 0:8:15.610
Benjamin Schaefer
However, it is.
0:8:16.730 --> 0:8:32.960
Benjamin Schaefer
For for changes hard maybe to put it in a in a simple term, change is very hard for people that are already used to doing things a particular way, regardless of whether or not they have a new way to do things that may be easier in aggregate it.
0:8:33.830 --> 0:8:35.410
Benjamin Schaefer
It is not an overnight.
0:8:38.570 --> 0:8:46.60
Benjamin Schaefer
I don't believe it to be an overnight flip of the switch. I think it could be, but I don't think that it's realistic that that we're gonna get that level of buying.
0:8:44.300 --> 0:8:54.510
Chris Messina
I it's gonna require a lot of marketing and communication with customers to get the visibility up and to ask the have them start asking. I wanna migrate.
0:8:55.220 --> 0:8:55.750
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK.
0:8:56.50 --> 0:8:59.990
Chris Messina
So we're not going to force anybody, but we're going to.
0:9:1.460 --> 0:9:4.290
Chris Messina
Promote the advantages and the.
0:9:5.50 --> 0:9:12.120
Chris Messina
Ability to of what's coming in the future as the way that you know we should position that and have them move to it.
0:9:12.680 --> 0:9:15.940
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK. And that's full authentication, authorization, everything.
0:9:16.440 --> 0:9:16.820
Chris Messina
Yes.
0:9:16.820 --> 0:9:18.500
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK, perfect.
0:9:18.360 --> 0:9:29.180
Benjamin Schaefer
So one of the and and that's sort of one of the reasons why if we can have things like a centralized usage, centralized entitlements view, you can be on opti ID.
0:9:49.810 --> 0:9:50.100
Oksana Kaliniouk
Added.
0:9:30.200 --> 0:9:55.30
Benjamin Schaefer
Without necessarily a conversion per se of all of your entitlements, and that is a thing for us to be able to think about, which is it it, there's a process that is required if we want to warm people up to an opti ID experience, we can warm up one person. That's why we need to make it incremental, right. We warm up one person. We can warm up, you know, one instance of their product.
0:9:57.940 --> 0:9:58.280
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK.
0:9:57.700 --> 0:9:59.110
Benjamin Schaefer
And and we'll show the value.
0:9:59.950 --> 0:10:12.560
Oksana Kaliniouk
So in my authorization tickets, should I add some sort of link back to admin Center for people who are on Opti ID? Because right now we obviously have our own.
0:10:14.990 --> 0:10:15.370
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah.
0:10:18.760 --> 0:10:19.130
Benjamin Schaefer
Yep.
0:10:13.220 --> 0:10:20.970
Oksana Kaliniouk
User management page and we're gonna lock it down where people cannot be edited from there. But do we want to sort of like dively?
0:10:21.780 --> 0:10:23.580
Oksana Kaliniouk
Push them. You know the right direction.
0:10:24.600 --> 0:10:25.540
Benjamin Schaefer
Uh.
0:10:30.30 --> 0:10:31.140
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
0:10:25.990 --> 0:10:32.380
Oksana Kaliniouk
That's just a requirement. They nothing has to be decided now on the spot because you know it's a designer thing and all of that.
0:10:39.130 --> 0:10:40.0
Oksana Kaliniouk
It's not hard.
0:10:32.120 --> 0:10:40.90
Benjamin Schaefer
You what you would need to do is to validate that they have admin center credentials, because until.
0:10:41.400 --> 0:10:43.290
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah. No, I agree, it's.
0:10:48.510 --> 0:10:48.870
Benjamin Schaefer
Sure.
0:10:50.10 --> 0:10:50.350
Benjamin Schaefer
Yep.
0:10:41.210 --> 0:10:50.840
Oksana Kaliniouk
Because either we're mark them, I mean we'll mark that as a field that the users have the ID because we have to, we can't find a way around it. So that's easy.
0:10:52.230 --> 0:11:23.510
Benjamin Schaefer
My point in saying is if they have admin center credentials then they can see the user management flow. Right now we're still ironing out how we're going to dog food rolls inside of admin center, and so imagine a scenario where like you're an ODP user like reader role. If that is how granular we wanna be able to go then in theory like maybe you could go and see in the admin center that's specific list of users and we would filter that list maybe by ODP.
0:11:23.610 --> 0:11:24.830
Benjamin Schaefer
A.
0:11:26.590 --> 0:11:34.960
Benjamin Schaefer
Products, but we just aren't there right now. And So what I would say is if you.
0:11:35.760 --> 0:11:39.410
Benjamin Schaefer
We should have another conversation about how you want to be able to link back to that. That's all.
0:11:40.30 --> 0:11:45.140
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK, so I'm assuming that Chris is going to put it on her list and I can stop thinking about it.
0:11:47.390 --> 0:11:47.880
Chris Messina
Yes.
0:11:47.670 --> 0:11:49.660
Oksana Kaliniouk
Cool. Thank you. I appreciate that.
0:11:50.740 --> 0:11:52.670
Chris Messina
My list is quite long however.
0:11:52.510 --> 0:11:54.260
Oksana Kaliniouk
I I understand.
0:11:53.220 --> 0:12:2.130
Benjamin Schaefer
I would, yeah, I would. That's a really good thing for a breakout conversation. So, so as you know what we've been trying to do is to like.
0:12:3.310 --> 0:12:10.340
Benjamin Schaefer
Save everybody a little bit of time. Our goal is to not get meeting fatigue. Our goal is to.
0:12:11.660 --> 0:12:41.330
Benjamin Schaefer
Organize and operationalize a across product initiative, but but to best do that, we need to make sure that devs have time to to get about their work. So we have breakout calls, we've reduced the office hours length by half an hour by a full hour a week, 1/2 an hour per session, and tried to do our absolute best to be on in terms of status updates, right? Getting real transparent conversations, getting on the same page because.
0:12:50.360 --> 0:12:50.680
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK.
0:12:41.610 --> 0:12:51.280
Benjamin Schaefer
It's unfortunate. I think we've been pretty consistent with explaining that our our GI is Q2, but we really just need to continue to hammer that home.
0:12:58.380 --> 0:13:1.580
Oksana Kaliniouk
If status is done, I have questions as per always.
0:13:3.130 --> 0:13:3.900
Benjamin Schaefer
Any other?
0:13:5.570 --> 0:13:8.740
Benjamin Schaefer
Questions. Comments regarding status timeline feature set.
0:13:11.400 --> 0:13:14.30
Johan Petersson
We talked about communicating.
0:13:15.280 --> 0:13:16.230
Johan Petersson
There is SanDisk.
0:13:17.40 --> 0:13:18.160
Johan Petersson
With the beta testers.
0:13:18.680 --> 0:13:24.570
Benjamin Schaefer
Chris knows more about that. Chris, do you wanna talk about how Zendesk for beta testers works?
0:13:25.300 --> 0:13:26.130
Chris Messina
Yep, so.
0:13:26.180 --> 0:13:32.420
Johan Petersson
OK. I was just wondering where can I add installation instructions and downloads?
0:13:34.550 --> 0:13:35.160
Chris Messina
Umm.
0:13:36.410 --> 0:13:41.480
Chris Messina
Do you have access to Zendesk? Actually? How about if we take it offline? I'll give you the.
0:13:42.180 --> 0:13:43.650
Chris Messina
The location and everything.
0:13:41.260 --> 0:13:44.270
Johan Petersson
OK. Yeah, I can see Zendesk in in October, but.
0:13:45.550 --> 0:13:49.70
Johan Petersson
I'm not able to log in so maybe I have to ask for access.
0:13:54.840 --> 0:13:55.230
Chris Messina
OK.
0:13:50.50 --> 0:14:0.210
Benjamin Schaefer
One thing I would say though is that this is probably worthwhile to document in confluence, and so regardless of how it gets to Zendesk, whether it's you know.
0:14:0.950 --> 0:14:21.900
Benjamin Schaefer
Basically a copy and paste twice. We should start centralizing our documentation in confluence so that devs essays on boarding. You know they all have access to the confluence page. They can be able to see that we can direct them to an internal link in addition to the end customers being able to see it in Zendesk.
0:14:22.250 --> 0:14:32.150
Chris Messina
So maybe the until you can get access to the page we can post it and confluence and then I'll just check it every day and I'll update the page.
0:14:33.500 --> 0:14:35.630
Chris Messina
Does do you guys have the link?
0:14:37.440 --> 0:14:37.850
Chris Messina
Or.
0:14:37.160 --> 0:14:39.320
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah, everybody should have the link to confluence.
0:14:39.780 --> 0:14:40.680
Oksana Kaliniouk
Confluence has but.
0:14:39.550 --> 0:14:42.400
Chris Messina
Yeah, I'll put it. I'll put it in the chat again.
0:14:42.900 --> 0:14:43.360
Oksana Kaliniouk
Thank you.
0:14:46.800 --> 0:14:50.10
Mark Metcalfe
And you're looking for the user doc for her opti ID as well.
0:14:56.130 --> 0:14:56.860
Johan Petersson
Ohh.
0:14:50.780 --> 0:14:58.690
Mark Metcalfe
And Zendesk when you say Zendesk that triggers documentation for me not support. What are you looking for?
0:15:1.500 --> 0:15:3.770
Johan Petersson
I don't know. That's a good question.
0:15:6.530 --> 0:15:8.60
Johan Petersson
But I guess, but what do you?
0:15:2.640 --> 0:15:8.550
Mark Metcalfe
Uh, I just let's put that in there and you can look at that and it's probably not what you want.
0:15:11.500 --> 0:15:12.60
Mark Metcalfe
That's right.
0:15:8.990 --> 0:15:13.40
Johan Petersson
But what you're referring to is the user guides, right? Not the developer docs, yeah.
0:15:14.150 --> 0:15:14.390
Johan Petersson
Yep.
0:15:13.210 --> 0:15:14.580
Mark Metcalfe
Correct. That's right.
0:15:21.480 --> 0:15:21.710
Mark Metcalfe
The.
0:15:21.50 --> 0:15:34.240
Oksana Kaliniouk
Somewhat in this vein of thought, is there a way where my issue gets get documented? Because I have people periodically reach out to me and say hey this is not working and hey that's not working and.
0:15:35.200 --> 0:15:40.220
Oksana Kaliniouk
Like am I the only one who is keeping track of it? Do it, document it? Does anybody else care?
0:15:42.280 --> 0:15:42.490
Chris Messina
So.
0:15:42.570 --> 0:15:51.980
Chris Messina
Well, I care. I would like to be have visibility to everything and I'd like to be able to document it as part of communication to all of the beta customers.
0:15:53.40 --> 0:15:54.580
Oksana Kaliniouk
Fabulous. Where do we put this?
0:15:55.690 --> 0:15:56.200
Chris Messina
So.
0:15:57.450 --> 0:16:3.230
Chris Messina
As part of the confluence page, I do have an issue triage process that I've put in in place.
0:16:5.710 --> 0:16:9.900
Chris Messina
But you can do a ticket directly to me in the IDX.
0:16:10.620 --> 0:16:11.80
Oksana Kaliniouk
I.
0:16:12.110 --> 0:16:13.460
Chris Messina
Or just send me a chat.
0:16:12.190 --> 0:16:14.770
Oksana Kaliniouk
I don't want to do tickets cause.
0:16:14.750 --> 0:16:15.950
Chris Messina
Just send me a chat then.
0:16:16.950 --> 0:16:25.330
Oksana Kaliniouk
But I I would like to actually have a place to record it. That way I can check it off as well because The thing is sometimes people don't communicate to me.
0:16:26.590 --> 0:16:31.420
Oksana Kaliniouk
So if we have somewhere where it's like ODP issues, that'd be swell.
0:16:32.440 --> 0:16:36.900
Oksana Kaliniouk
I can reach out to you after the meeting and make sure I know where to put it and where you can keep track of that.
0:16:37.220 --> 0:16:37.610
Chris Messina
OK.
0:16:38.600 --> 0:16:50.90
Oksana Kaliniouk
And also if anybody experiences an issue with ODP which you should have but nobody complained when I release one hour, please put it there or check if we have something there.
0:16:51.720 --> 0:17:0.760
Chris Messina
So how it works for the customer standpoint is they will follow the process of how they would submit a usual support ticket.
0:17:1.420 --> 0:17:11.980
Chris Messina
And I've worked with support to the customers that are in the beta program will get flagged and the support team will look at them and then they will send me.
0:17:12.820 --> 0:17:13.890
Chris Messina
A JIRA ticket.
0:17:15.140 --> 0:17:16.510
Chris Messina
In the IDX.
0:17:17.30 --> 0:17:24.650
Chris Messina
Umm board assigned to me so that I can actually go and look at them all and then reroute them as needed. So it.
0:17:25.470 --> 0:17:29.310
Chris Messina
If it's an ODP specific issue then I can alert that to you as well.
0:17:46.890 --> 0:17:47.900
Oksana Kaliniouk
Have more question?
0:17:47.90 --> 0:17:50.530
Chris Messina
And Johan, I updated the beta page for the out.
0:17:51.250 --> 0:17:59.360
Chris Messina
When facing beta page with your releases that you had posted in Confluence, I updated the beta page itself with that already.
0:18:4.10 --> 0:18:7.670
Johan Petersson
Where can I see that page for me?
0:18:6.990 --> 0:18:8.690
Chris Messina
I'll send you the link for that as well.
0:18:8.390 --> 0:18:9.170
Johan Petersson
OK, perfect.
0:18:11.540 --> 0:18:19.730
Johan Petersson
Because there must be some installations instructions that goes with that download. Otherwise I guess they don't understand how to use it.
0:18:21.730 --> 0:18:22.980
Oksana Kaliniouk
Our question for Kevin.
0:18:27.230 --> 0:18:27.620
Kevin Shea
Shoot.
0:18:25.730 --> 0:18:33.130
Oksana Kaliniouk
Umm we have feature roles or feature flag and roles namely where we're releasing PII.
0:18:33.840 --> 0:18:46.410
Oksana Kaliniouk
Ability to read PII or not. Currently we're releasing it to converse only. Meaning can we hide roles from some customers like is that is there a plan to do that by the end of this work?
0:18:47.550 --> 0:18:48.610
Kevin Shea
Yes, absolutely.
0:18:48.880 --> 0:18:49.210
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK.
0:18:50.430 --> 0:18:56.720
Kevin Shea
I believe that our back end system currently supports that. I just need to review a couple of requirements with Lee through the the UI.
0:18:58.100 --> 0:19:5.720
Kevin Shea
But I it is definitely something that we will be supporting and I think we're not too far off from being able to support it very soon.
0:19:6.210 --> 0:19:20.810
Oksana Kaliniouk
And then I have sort of a follow-up question. Currently I control the flag right. ODP controls the flag. What is their intention going forward? If we say releasing a new role, who controls turning it on and off?
0:19:21.610 --> 0:19:22.190
Kevin Shea
It.
0:19:23.30 --> 0:19:36.310
Kevin Shea
Well, who controls it would really be, I guess anybody who can edit the role within admin center. So you could control it if if you like, but you would define within the role you would just define what customers should be able to access that role.
0:19:37.110 --> 0:19:37.460
Oksana Kaliniouk
Got it.
0:19:37.210 --> 0:19:40.280
Kevin Shea
And everything should just flow down from there.
0:19:55.500 --> 0:19:59.910
Oksana Kaliniouk
Umm I have a question about global NAV bar.
0:20:0.910 --> 0:20:5.700
Oksana Kaliniouk
Sort of a general question of what happens if there is a failure.
0:20:6.450 --> 0:20:24.270
Oksana Kaliniouk
So if there's a if we don't read the cookie, if we can't communicate, if everything like that, and more specifically with the sign out button, because we just keep encountering new ways of failing, and I need to have a sign out button. If we're removing it from ODP.
0:20:25.560 --> 0:20:33.510
Oksana Kaliniouk
Even if they're even, if there's zero communication I need for the customer to be able to sign out of ODP regardless of what's happening.
0:20:37.160 --> 0:20:37.690
Oksana Kaliniouk
So.
0:20:38.720 --> 0:20:40.360
Oksana Kaliniouk
I would like that to be planned.
0:20:44.630 --> 0:20:46.940
Benjamin Schaefer
Sorry, the sign out button should already be there.
0:20:47.890 --> 0:20:52.650
Oksana Kaliniouk
So if there is, if there are issues with syndication or you know.
0:20:54.900 --> 0:20:55.570
Oksana Kaliniouk
It has.
0:20:59.270 --> 0:20:59.870
Victor Hernandez
Still.
0:20:56.390 --> 0:21:1.770
Oksana Kaliniouk
I will check but the the bar doesn't load if there's no user, right?
0:21:2.230 --> 0:21:10.60
Victor Hernandez
Yeah. If if there's no user that many doesn't load the menu with the log out button and I thought we already discussed having weight force that log out button to be shown.
0:21:10.790 --> 0:21:11.340
Benjamin Schaefer
Yeah.
0:21:18.480 --> 0:21:18.730
Oksana Kaliniouk
OK.
0:21:11.0 --> 0:21:19.40
Victor Hernandez
I don't know if we put a story together, but I know you already brought it up and I think we agreed that we'd be able to to set that up for you.
0:21:19.720 --> 0:21:29.270
Oksana Kaliniouk
So it's on your road map and then I don't have to worry about that. I'm trying to keep a lot of details in my head. So I'm sorry if I'm being repetitive.
0:21:30.10 --> 0:21:30.450
Benjamin Schaefer
No.
0:21:30.80 --> 0:21:31.240
Victor Hernandez
You're good, OK.
0:21:34.430 --> 0:21:34.970
Benjamin Schaefer
All good.
0:21:38.60 --> 0:21:54.860
Johan Petersson
I will have a question regarding the product Switcher. What what? What is the default behavior when I change organization? Right now it seems like it reloads the instances drop down, but then it tries to navigate to the first first instance.
0:21:56.180 --> 0:21:58.30
Johan Petersson
Is that supposed to be the default behavior?
0:21:59.30 --> 0:22:1.330
Johan Petersson
Because that might be a completely different product.
0:22:3.610 --> 0:22:5.280
Victor Hernandez
Yes, that's how it's been implemented.
0:22:6.980 --> 0:22:12.770
Johan Petersson
And that's actually my issue right now because I cannot switch to to another organization.
0:22:13.850 --> 0:22:15.770
Johan Petersson
When I'm in admin center because then I get.
0:22:16.550 --> 0:22:29.20
Johan Petersson
Redirected to the post portal where I don't have access and I basically don't have any instance where I can switch to another organization without being redirected to passportal.
0:22:30.110 --> 0:22:30.730
Benjamin Schaefer
Ohh.
0:22:33.300 --> 0:22:36.800
Benjamin Schaefer
That's strange that you got redirected to the passportal though. If you didn't have access.
0:22:38.250 --> 0:22:41.100
Benjamin Schaefer
Because that would suggest that in that other org.
0:22:38.750 --> 0:22:46.100
Johan Petersson
Well, well, I mean I I I guess technically I I have access but there are login issues right now in passport on, right.
0:22:53.130 --> 0:22:53.430
Johan Petersson
Yeah.
0:22:55.20 --> 0:22:55.430
Johan Petersson
Exactly.
0:22:48.370 --> 0:23:2.760
Benjamin Schaefer
I see. So basically, if raw, if Ronnie or Anders made it so that you could log in, that would no longer be the problem. But hypothetically the scenario, OK, so this is an edge case that could potentially happen where someone would need to back arrow back to an org.
0:23:5.400 --> 0:23:6.690
Benjamin Schaefer
When there's something broken.
0:23:3.850 --> 0:23:11.730
Johan Petersson
Yes, but it's still an issue that track. For example, if I am in admin center and I wanna switch organization and edit.
0:23:12.940 --> 0:23:13.580
Johan Petersson
Usage.
0:23:14.240 --> 0:23:26.710
Johan Petersson
In the other word then I get. Then I have to 1st navigate to Passportal and then in Passportal I switch org again and then I'm I get redirected again to passport.
0:23:29.600 --> 0:23:30.800
Johan Petersson
Basically what I'm saying is.
0:23:32.0 --> 0:23:33.510
Johan Petersson
When I change org.
0:23:34.180 --> 0:23:37.170
Johan Petersson
Nothing should happen except for.
0:23:37.830 --> 0:23:40.100
Johan Petersson
Refreshing the instance drop down.
0:23:49.0 --> 0:23:57.420
Benjamin Schaefer
What? So it's a little complicated. We're actually trying to work on a sort of an interstitial page.
0:24:3.10 --> 0:24:19.520
Benjamin Schaefer
What we have, we don't have that yet in full transparency, but we are well aware of how clunky that organization switching experiences it is not desirable.
0:24:19.830 --> 0:24:32.300
Johan Petersson
Because we could, we could Amit, Justin event and then it's up to the app to navigate or not. But the default behavior I assume should be that only the instance drop down is refreshed with the new instances for that work.
0:24:34.800 --> 0:24:35.560
Benjamin Schaefer
UM.
0:24:37.230 --> 0:24:43.320
Benjamin Schaefer
The That's an interesting point is that it would be on the app to redirect.
0:24:44.870 --> 0:24:47.950
Benjamin Schaefer
The application I hadn't really thought about that.
0:24:48.270 --> 0:25:1.220
Johan Petersson
Well, not only redirect, they could do other things like just refresh the app for the new org or something. I don't know. I guess it's very domain specific what switching org means in in the app.
0:25:2.200 --> 0:25:10.180
Benjamin Schaefer
And I think that's, yeah, that's true, which is why this interstitial page should help us to solve a lot of those problems because effectively what that allows for us to do.
0:25:10.970 --> 0:25:41.310
Benjamin Schaefer
It's to say, listen, we're gonna genericize this such that whenever you switch into an organization, you're going to get a product Switcher that is populated in an unopinionated way. It will be strictly reflective of the permission scheme that you have access to in that newly switched org and where we aren't quite yet is that experience. But we've just been working through some of our Q2Q3 road map initiatives.
0:25:41.390 --> 0:25:45.970
Benjamin Schaefer
And that is one that was a really hot topic, so.
0:25:47.160 --> 0:25:53.580
Johan Petersson
I don't think it's common at least not now in the beginning that you are a member of multiple works. I assume.
0:25:54.730 --> 0:25:55.160
Johan Petersson
Yeah.
0:25:53.470 --> 0:26:1.590
Benjamin Schaefer
That's the thing, right? But this is sort of an interesting opportunity for us just to kind of call out maybe some of the ideas around this.
0:26:2.940 --> 0:26:13.830
Benjamin Schaefer
Our hope is that moving forward, you know this can do a lot more for us it it can be maybe an opportunity for us to.
0:26:15.570 --> 0:26:29.340
Benjamin Schaefer
Simplify a butter bars. You know, sort of like around statuses for for product lines or for particular customers have have a spot for like optimizely wide call to actions for that organization.
0:26:30.340 --> 0:26:34.520
Benjamin Schaefer
It can. It can potentially show recently.
0:26:37.0 --> 0:26:38.130
Benjamin Schaefer
Recently.
0:26:40.370 --> 0:26:54.150
Benjamin Schaefer
Navigated to links. You could theoretically like know where the person had been in the context of that organization and the past and sort of show that as sort of a jump off spot. The sort of de facto example of this is office.com.
0:26:55.270 --> 0:27:14.560
Benjamin Schaefer
When you go to office.com, it has all the apps. It's got their product switching capability, but it also provides you a recommendation of some of the topics that you might be interested in across the respective products that you have in the office suite that shows the last couple of things that you've been doing in those sort of like respective products and.
0:27:15.840 --> 0:27:20.530
Benjamin Schaefer
Our hope is that we can sort of evolve the experience significantly by.
0:27:22.970 --> 0:27:25.0
Benjamin Schaefer
Being less opinionated but.
0:27:25.100 --> 0:27:28.370
Benjamin Schaefer
A providing a it's just another.
0:27:28.470 --> 0:27:56.360
Benjamin Schaefer
Uh, view around for our our partners and for our customers to be able to kind of say, hey, here's a call to action, have you are you aware of the fact that like your organization hasn't taken advantage of some of the freemium products, we have talk to your admin or if you're an admin go auto provision those right, like there's a lot of lot of opportunities by having something that's a little bit more optimizely marketing centric. And I still valuable to customers.
0:28:1.660 --> 0:28:9.900
Benjamin Schaefer
Anyway, more to come on that. So that again, we're not trying to push that for GA. I think we really awesome if we could, but I think my team.
0:28:9.990 --> 0:28:17.140
Benjamin Schaefer
A. You know, that's more than enough on their plate right now for us to be able to meet our GA requirements.
0:28:27.930 --> 0:28:28.960
Benjamin Schaefer
Yay.
0:28:23.660 --> 0:28:29.260
Ronny Karlsson
I think at least we will fairly soon have the translation in Opti idea as well, so that it should work better for you to well.
0:28:30.650 --> 0:28:31.50
Benjamin Schaefer
That.
0:28:29.970 --> 0:28:35.740
Ronny Karlsson
So yeah, let's maybe at the end of next week, if you add your user to user group with Texas.
0:28:37.180 --> 0:28:42.930
Benjamin Schaefer
That's super useful Ronny too, because then, uh uh, the essays wouldn't have to change their UPN.
0:28:44.650 --> 0:28:45.670
Benjamin Schaefer
At least in theory.
0:28:46.820 --> 0:28:54.160
Benjamin Schaefer
Because then we could just add those new optimizely users into the Paas. Is that right? And then use the rules that we have assigned for them and and the optimize the org?
0:28:56.380 --> 0:28:57.150
Ronny Karlsson
Yeah, exactly.
0:28:57.890 --> 0:29:1.200
Benjamin Schaefer
Same same for the marketing folks. That would be amazing.
0:29:6.10 --> 0:29:8.440
Benjamin Schaefer
Alright, we're at time. Sorry other questions.
0:29:10.910 --> 0:29:12.20
Benjamin Schaefer
No other questions.
0:29:16.270 --> 0:29:16.650
Benjamin Schaefer
OK.
0:29:17.770 --> 0:29:21.360
Benjamin Schaefer
Thanks so much everybody for the hard work. Talk to you again next week. Have a great weekend.
0:29:21.880 --> 0:29:22.160
Oksana Kaliniouk
Bye.
0:29:22.280 --> 0:29:22.720
Benjamin Schaefer
Bye bye.
0:29:22.740 --> 0:29:23.160
Victor Hernandez
Right, right.
0:29:22.810 --> 0:29:23.210
Johan Petersson
Bye.
0:29:23.160 --> 0:29:23.410
Saivenkat Thumala
OK.
